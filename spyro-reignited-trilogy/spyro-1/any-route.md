# SRT Spyro 1 Any% Routing Guide

This is an introductory routing guide for Spyro 1 Any% in the Reignited Trilogy. It is intended to be a textual resource you can reference during a run to remember where to go and what to collect while you learn the run. It is intentionally verbose to avoid leaving out anything that might not be obvious.

Specific movement mechanics are not covered in this guide.

A complete list of discovered tricks for this game can be found in [this Google Doc](https://goo.gl/T1BjoR).

The leaderboards for this category are available [on speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/spyrort#Spyro_the_Dragon). Currently, timing is based off of In Game Time (IGT), which is found by checking the guidebook in the game menus. RTA time is also part of the submission. A Loadless timer is in the works (will be linked here when available), and that will likely become the primary timing method for this category.


**Note:** This guide provides _a_ route for the any% run, but as the game is still new, the route may change quickly. I'll try to keep this guide up to date, but it may fall out of date for periods of time as new things get found.



## Progression Requirements

Each homeworld has a requirement that you must meet in order to progress to the next world. These requirements are cumulative, and the route works towards all of the goals throughout the run to meet them as quickly as possible. These requirements are:

- **Artisans:** 10 dragons
- **Peace Keepers:** 1,200 gems
- **Magic Craters:** 5 eggs
- **Beast Makers:** 50 dragons
- **Dream Weavers:** 6,000 gems



## Routing

Timing starts when you select Spyro 1 from the game selection menu. You must start on a new save file. Timing will end on the last hit to Gnasty Gnorc, though you won't be able to check your IGT in the guidebook until after the credits play.

### Stone Hill (Game Start)

After fade in, get Nestor first (the dragon right in front of you), using the [Nestor Skip][1] to skip his dialogue. Unlike normal dragons, Nestor's dialogue is normally unskippable, but by jumping upward as you trigger him, you will be able to skip his dialogue like any other dragon. Where you hit his pedestal is not important, so long as you have upward momentum when you do so.

Turn immediately left, collect the red gems on the pedestal, and get the second dragon (Delbin). Turn around and head into Stone Hill.

In Stone Hill, head straight forward to the end of level vortex and rescue Astor. Get the 5 gem in the chest to his left before hand. Head back through the building and to the right, into the room to rescue Lindar, collecting all the gems along the way.

Back out, down the well, and rescue Gavin. Exit the level.

_After this split, aim for ~59 gems, 5 dragons, and 0 eggs._



### Town Square

Head immediately right (camera's perspective) and through the tunnel toward Town Square, rescue Tomas. Up the whirlwind and into the level.

In the level, head up the stairs, collect the chest gems, and rescue Nils. Use the [Fairy Flick][1] to get to the upper platform right away. A consistent way to get the flick is to have two of Spyro's feet on the center section of the pedestal and the other two on the outer ring. Watch the video for a better idea of exact placement.


#### If you get to the upper platform

Rescue Thor and collec the fan chest, enemy, and chest gems. Drop down to rescue Alvar, then collect the gems behind the vortex. Backtrack through the corridor down to the lower area, collect the chest gems, and rescue Devlin.

Exit the level by travelling to Artisans via the Guidebook.


#### If you miss the upper platform

You will lose ~15 seconds, but it is not the end of the world. Cross the gap, head up the stairs, get the gems. Cross the next gap and then rescue Devlin. Grab the gems in the chests and head up the stairs.

Turn around and jump to the right to get up to the upper area with the thief. Collect gems and head through the tunnel, catch up to the thief and jump-flame him as he drops down to the bottom _but make sure you stay up top_. The timing is fairly lenient. Cross the gap, collect the gems, then cross over to rescue Thor. Collect the fan chest and other gems up there, then drop down to rescue Alvar. Collect some straggling gems.

Exit the level by travelling to Artisans via the Guidebook.

_After this split, aim for ~155 gems, 10 dragons, and maybe 1 egg._



### Artisans

Travel back to the Toasty area and rescue Argus, then head to the balloonist, collecting the enemy and chest gems on your way. Then Head to Peace Keepers.

_After this split, aim for ~180 gems, 10 dragons, and maybe 1 egg._



### Dry Canyon

Rescue Titan right at the start, then head to Dry Canyon, collecting the enemy gems on the way (~25 total).

In Dry Canyon, collect the fan chest 10 gem right at the start, then head forward. Collect the chest and enemy gems on the way to rescue Conan on the platform to the right. Continue forward, collecting all the enemy and ground gems. Up the stairs and rescue Boris.

Turn around to continue through the level, collect all the enemy gems, and head to the vortex area. Collect the enemy and chest gems, then jump the gap to the right. You'll need a full jump from the edge of the platform to make this, Spyro will likely autohover for it. Head up the path and rescue Maximos, then exit the level.

_After this split, aim for ~400 gems, 15 dragons, and 0-1 eggs._



### Cliff Town

Head to the right out of the level (Spyro's perspective), collect the gems from the enemies in the group of 3, then enter Cliff Town.

In the level, head to the left out the door and around the back of the level. [Jump around the wall][3] to get to the back area early. You'll need to jump late and wait a little bit to start turning to make the jump. Collect the 25 in the chest and head back to the rest of the level.

Past the bridge, collect the Mama and enemy gems, then head over the next bridge and go to the left to rescue Halvor. Directly behind Spyro, jump onto the building, then turn around and [jump up to the taller building][3] with the two 10 gem chests on it. Jump to the right to the other building with the 10 gem chest and flame the rocket. To flame it consistently. Push forward while facing directly into the wall, full jump, and flame as you get to the top of the jump. You'll hear the rocket ignite.

jump off and head right to collect the enemies and two 5 gems before going up the cliff buildings. Collect all the enemy and chest gems on the way up, including the ones around the vortex, then rescue Enzo at the top. Then exit the level.

_After this split, aim for ~650 gems, 17 dragons, and 0-1 eggs._



### Night Flight

In the level, collect the chest gems at the start, flame the mama+enemy, collect the gems on the steps to the right. Continue forward, collect the gems on the stairs on the left, continue forward.

Collect all the enemy gems on the way to the whirlwind behind the tower. Head up, get the 5s on top, then through the tunnel to rescue Trondo, getting the 10 gem chest as you do. Exit the level.

_After this split, aim for ~1155 gems, 19 dragons, and 1-2 eggs._


### Ice Cavern

Head straight from Shemp to the left (Spyro's perspective) and into Ice Cavern.

In the level, head immediately left, and collect the enemy gems on the way to rescue Ulric. Head through the tunnel (get the 10 gem on the ledge) and keep heading into the next building/room. Go onto the top ledge and collect the chest gems before heading right and rescuing Todor.

Head left up into the next cavern, collect the chest and enemy gems, then straight forward to rescue Andor. There's a 5 gem right under the ledge before you drop down, so flop off the ledge instead of continuing charging to get it.

Head out into the main area, up the curved ramp, and cross the gap to rescue Asher. Jump up the pillar stairs into the upper set of caverns, collect the enemy and chest gems, and charge the lamp post with the 10 gem on it to get it. Then jump the gap up to rescue Ragnar and exit the level.


_After this split, aim for ~1360 gems, 24 dragons, and 1-2 eggs._


### Peace Keepers

Head up the ramp to rescue Magnus, then talk to the balloonist and head to Magic Crafters. **The balloonist only has one dialogue box before the travel/stay selection.** All the other balloonists have two, so be careful mashing through his dialogue.

_After this split, aim for ~1370 gems, 25 dragons, and 1-2 eggs._



### Alpine Ridge

Head into the caves/rooms and jump-glide-flame the thief as he moves to the left, the go right and rescue Cosmos. Collect the enemy gems before continuing forward. Get the spring chest and fan chest gems on the right before heading into Alpine Ridge.

Collect the gems, cross the gap, and rescue Eldrid.

Head up the ledge, collect the chest gems between the ramps, then continue up and head into the dark cave area to the left of the druid that raises the large enemy up. Collect the enemy and chest gems, then back out and continue up to rescue Zander, collecting the gems on the way.

Cross the long gap to the far tunnel and rescue Kelvin, then exit the level.

Head forward toward the cave far in front of you, collecting the spring chests on the way, then the fireworks chests in the room. Turn around jump out to the left into the first cave and collect the chest gems, then exit the level.

_After this split, aim for ~2075 gems, 33 dragons, and 3-4 eggs._



### Wizard Peak

Out of the level, rescue Zantor immediately to Spyro's left (hold directly right as you gain control). Take the supercharge down and through the tunnel out to the right and break the strong chest. Collect the enemy gems from the two enemies, then head up into Wizard Peak.

In the level, head through the level like normal, collecting the enemy and chest gems along the way until you get to rescue Jarvis. Then head down the supercharge ramp. As you leave the tunnel, swerve right to collect the fan chests gems, then hold left to turn and head into the second ramp to the lower area. Carry the supercharge forward up the next ramp and jump to the distant island. Collect all the gems on the island and the thief around the back of it before death abusing off the platform.

You'll respawn at Jarvis, then supercharge back down, and turn sharp right after the second ramp to get the strong chest before turning left again to rescue Hexus.

Continue forward collecting the enemy gems on the way up. If you did _not_ collect the Town Square thief egg, jump-flame the thief around the pond on the way up to get your 5th egg. Continue upward collecting all the gems, rescue Lucas, then exit the level.


_After this split, aim for ~2500 gems, 37 dragons, and 5 eggs. These are the last eggs you'll collect, so they will be omitted from here on._



### Crystal Flight

Immedaitely to Spyro's right out of the level, collect the 25 gem from the spring chest and the enemy gem, then head back into the cave and turn right. Collect the spring chest gems and enter Crystal Flight.

A [popular route is available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZV_zsgG6Ek).

_After this split, aim for ~2850 gems and 37 dragons._



### Blowhard

As you exit Crystal Flight, you'll automatically rescue Boldar. Turn around and head back out into the lower area, and collect all the gems around there before entering Blowhard.

In the level, collect all the enemy and chest gems in the first area as you progress up to Blowhard's first hit. You can just flame him at any point in his animations.

Turn around and enter the cave, collecting the ground and enemy gems on the way up. At the middle, to the right, collect the chest gems and rescue Altair.

Head back out and continue up, collecting the enemy gems. Out of the cave, collect the chest gems to the left before turning to the right and continuing to Blowhard's second hit. Cross the gap, collect the spring chest gems, hti Blowhard the final time and collect his gems, then exit the level.

_After this split, aim for ~3320 gems and 39 dragons._



### Magic Crafters

Just head to the balloonist and travel on to Beast Makers.

_After this split, aim for ~3320 gems and 39 dragons._



### Terrace Village

As you come off the balloon, head forward and to the right, collect the chest/ground gems, then jump around the ledge to get behind the Terrace Village porta. Collect the chest gems and enter the level.

In the level, head straight forward collecting enemy gems in the first area, then go around the left side collecting the chest gems. Get the enemy gems in the second area, then head up the steps to rescue Claude.

Head directly to the right in the next area, flaming the rocket right there. In the passageway, collect the enemy and chest gems before crossing the gap. You'll need a solid jump to make the gap, and will probably autohover to make it. Then head on top of the building, cross back over the gap to the other building, collect the chest gems and flame the second rocket (end of the longer platform) before dropping down and to the left across the electric pad.

Go around the back of the building to collect the enemy/strong chest gems, then progress across the pads collecting the enemy gems on the way. Rescue Cyprin, then head up the steps onto the pad. Collect the enemy gems, then drop down to the left to the lower back area. Collect all the chest and enemy gems as you go along that path, then exit the level.

_After this split, aim for ~3525 gems and 41 dragons._

As you exit Terrace Village, turn to Spyro's left and rescue Bruno. Then head left (camera's perspective), collect the fireworks chest gems, and cross the gaps over to the island on the right. Head behind the hut, killing the boar that runs at you with a flame. As you come around, ehad into the hut and collect the chest gems. Back out of the hut, get the fan chests in front of you, then drop down the well into Wild Flight.

A [popular route is available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXF5VEdFzds).

_After this split, aim for ~3950 gems and 42 dragons._



### Misty Bog

As you exit, collect the gems in the well and go up the whirlwind. Rescue Cleetus, then head into Misty Bog.

In the level, immediately turn around to the back of the first island. Collect the gems back there, then glide over the water towards the end of level vortex. You'll have to damage abuse once to make it. Aim toward the right of the lower plateau to land in a clear area before cleaning up the boars and enemies, and collecting the spring chest gem.

Up the stairs, rescue Bubba, then jump across the buildings, up the broken wall steps. Collect the chest gems up top, then cross the gap to the tree stumps, follow the path, and collect the chest gems before crossing the gap back to the main part of the level. Clear all the frogs and tree enemies, collect all the gems on that plateau, then rescue Rosco.

Turn around, jump to the island with the boar and enemy, collect the gems, and jump back to the bridge section. Clear the enemies along there and up into the tree stump, then jump down. Collect all the ground, chest, and enemy gems, then up the steps to rescue Zeke and exit the level.

_After this split, aim for ~4300 gems and 46 dragons._



### Tree Tops

Head toe Spyro's right out of the level, collect the green gems and boar gems, then head around the right side of the tree. After the first root, there's a 10 gem near the stump. Hop over the second root and into Tree Tops.

In the level, head forward like normal, collecting the enemy gems on the way. In the room with two windows, jump out the second window to take the alternate path (following the green thief). Keep going, collecting the enemy and chest gems (get the key!), up the steps and across the gap to rescue Lyle. Don't bother getting the gems on the plateau to the right beforehand, just stick to the left.

Head down the supercharge ramp and cross the long gap to the island with the green thief. The simplest way to make this jump is to curl off the right side of the ramp, keep turning to land on the ramp that's attached to the tree, then jump off that ramp's end to cross the gap (don't have a clip video yet).

On the island, rescue Jed and collect all the gems before taking the whirlwind back. As you come back, drop to collect the chest gems before continuing forward and slightly to the left to cross the gap back to the main path of the level. Drop down into the pit, collecting the enemy and chest gems before coming back up the steps and rescuing Isaak.

Take the supercharge ramp across the gap into the room right in front, collect all the gems in that room, then up to the second supercharge. Go down the supercharge, but curl around once to land back on the supercharge ramp and gain more speed before crossing the gap up to the top area of the last island. [Watch this video for an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TV18FqDn8PY).

Alternatively, from Isaak, take the supercharge and jump to the right, follow the path around and through the tree, then land on the second supercharge and charge up to the island. This is a bit simpler, but you will miss out on ~40 gems from that middle room. You can make up these gems in Jacques fairly easily.

Once on the top of the last island, collect all the gems up top, then drop down and collect the remaining gems, then exit the level.

_After this split, aim for ~4700 gems and 49 dragons._



### Metalhead

Head forward over the bridge, jump onto the halfwall, then jump and glide across into Metalhead. Alternatively, jump onto the well ledge and then into Metalhead.

In the level, head straight forward, charging the rolling enemies. Up the steps, the down into the back area through the broken gate on the right. Go up and around to collect all the gems and the key at the top of the stairs, then take the whirlwind up. Collect the chest gems on the first platform, then drop to the right. Collect the enemy gems before crossing the bridge.

Flame the firework chest on the left before clearing the enemies straight ahead on top of the stairs. Turn left and drop down to collect the firework chest gems, then turn around to progress thruogh the level. Collect the gems to the left of the stairs, then head up them, clear the enemies, and head down the ramp to rescue Sadiki.

In the Metalhead room, destroy the pillars to clear the first phase. Head through the door, then up the stairs to the left to get the gems up top. Continue forward, then head along the left wall in the next area to behind the waterfall to collect the key chest and spring chest gems.

Clear Metalhead's second phase, collect the gems, then head into the room, up the whirlwind, collect the gems along the ledge. Out the window, along the ledge to the left, and collect the last two chest gems, then exit the level.

_After this split, aim for ~5100 gems and 50 dragons._


### Beast Makers

Out of the level, head to Spyro's right to collect the fan chests and the electric pad enemy. Then turn around, up the steps on the wall, cross the gap to the tree stump with the key, and back to the main area, collecting all the gems on the way. Clear the second pad enemy, drop down to get the chest gems on the lower area, get the key chest, then jump back up to the balloonist to head to Dream Weavers.

_After this split, aim for ~5200 gems and 50 dragons. Dragons are not important after this split, so they will be omitted._



### Icy Flight

If you are short on gems, this is where you should really start picking up extra gems where possible to avoid a very long Jacques route. Anything less than 5100 will require lots of extra gems from this route.

Collect all the gems from the first floating island, before heading to the right and collecting the enemy gems and crossing to the next platform. You can either take the whirlwind or do a tight jump from the edge of the lower island up to the higher one (no video to link, yet).

Head to the left across the island, skipping the metal fool enemies. Down to the lower floating island straight ahead, up the whirlwinds to the cannon platform. Shoot the metal fool enemies to shrink them, then cross the gap and head up the stairs. Cross the ledge and flame the two fools to raise the platforms. Head up to get the fireworks chest (the knockback from the chest will always knock you off, so flame it then stand on the edge of the platform). Jump over and head into Icy Flight.

(No video of the route for Icy, but it's pretty straightforward).

_After this split, aim for ~5700 gems._



### Jacques

Head to the left of the Icy Flight portal (camera's perspective) and jump down and across toward the balloonist. Follow the path backward and enter Jacques on your left.

Routing in Jacques depends on how many gems you need, so instead of a route, here are some simple guidelines for making your requirements:

- You need 6000 gems to leave Dream Weavers.
- Completing the Jacques fight and getting the gems near the vortex will give you 150 gems.
- heading directly to Jacques following the right side of the level will only give you ~60 gems.
- taking the left route toward Jacques _without the key for the chest_ will give you ~100 gems.
- taking the left route _with_ the key chest will give you ~170 gems.
- At best, routing a single pass to Jacques will give you 360 gems.
  - If you need up to 430 gems, beat Jacques, then backtrack down the right path (to your left coming back from the fight) to pick up what you need.
  - If you need 440-460 gems, it'll be faster to exit the level after backtracking and collect straggling gems in the homeworld.
  - If you need all 500 gems, continue backtracking and head to the alternate path on the left to 100% the level.


_After this split, aim for ~6000 gems. All requirements are met at this point, so this section will be omitted from now on._



### Dreamweavers

If you don't have 6000 gems, collect what you need from the homeworld (or fast travel back to another level if you need even more for whatever reason). Head to the balloonist and onward to Gnorc Nexus.



### Gnorc Cove

Entering the Nexus, you need to talk to Delbin to unlock Gnorc Cove, so do that, then head left into the level.

In the level, head straight forward, jump the gap to the left, then jump up to the end of the bridge to the boat with a full jump. [Watch this video for an example](https://clips.twitch.tv/WonderfulInexpensiveClipsdadUncleNox). Alternatively, curl around to the right on the first dock, jump up to the higher platforms, and cross the bridge normally. This will lose ~8 seconds if done decently.

Through the boat continue progressing normally until you pass the second dragon. If you have at least green sparx, you can skip going down into the pit and instead cross over it and jump straight to the end of level vortex, damging once to make the jump. [Here's an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ew3LO6KGlh0). If you don't have sparx, drop down, flame the rats to get sparx back, then head forward and defeat the enemies to reach the whirlwind and leave via the vortex.

**You must leave the level via the vortex to unlock Twilight Harbor.**



### Twilight Harbor

There are a bunch of strats that work in this level, but simply progress through the level as directly as possible to reach the vortex. Don't take any detours (obviously).

After the first dragon, when entering the next room, remember to flame charge the large enemies, otherwise they may turn around and shoot you as your charge away.

After you pass the second dragon and go through the following room (right after the supercharge ramp), you can jump directly across the gap instead of going through the upper room.

To quickly pass the last 3 large enemies near the end, stay to the right of the platforms, then jump over their shots to the left side and flame them to avoid having them potentially shoot you. The last small enemy can also cause problems, so it's best to flame him at the same time as the last large enemy. Leave the level via the vortex.

**You must leave the level via the vortex to unlock Gnasty Gnrc.**



### Gnasty Gnorc

Out of Twilight Harbor, hold right as you gain control, then charge jump onto the dragon head with Gnasty's portal and enter the Gnasty Gnorc.

In the level, head back-right toward the first thief. By aiming to the right of the thief, you should be able to flame charge and hit him before he can move too far and get the key. If so, immediately turn around and head to the left in the big room to get to the second thief door. Otherwise, chase the thief, get the key, then head to the second thief.

The second thief (for now) can't be flame charged right away. Instead just charge around the first corner, but aim to the left of the second one and flame charge for a quick thief hit. If you get the key, turn around and head back across the room, otherwise chase the thief and then head toward Gnasty.

You do not need to jump over the ridges in the middle of the room.

After unlocking the stairs to Gnasty, follow him for a little bit, but then charge jump the left as soon as it opens up and glide down to the lower section. As Gnasty catches up, land behind him and continue chasing. He can push you off the platform if you are in front/next to him, so be careful. Continue the chase until Gnasty is standing on his pedestal, then jump and flame him quickly. Timing might be a little tight, but not too difficult with decent movement through the earlier parts of the level.

After the short cutscene, follow Gnasty across the platforms and flame him to end the run. RTA/Loadless time ends when you flame Gnasty in that last area. To get your IGT time, skip through the credits and then check the guidebook as soon as possible.
